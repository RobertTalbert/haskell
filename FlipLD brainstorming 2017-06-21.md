- Study ONLY metacognition scores 
- Layer on interviews for LD students (if there are no LD students, we still have the data for metacognition)
- Collect data during entire 2017-2018 year and beyond if needed
- Design intervention for FL in foundations courses consisting of flipped materials, metacognitive coaching, formative assessment


Give metacognitive coaching for ALL students. 
But pick out "experiment" sections for interventions and FL approach. 

For a lesson: 
- Support mechanism for textbook along with video (put on Bb site) and activities 
- Pre-class assignment and formative assessment including basic metacognition questions
- In-class activities focusing on applications and critical thinking
- End-of class activities focusing on metacognition and elaboration

Do this 2-3 times during the semester. 
Measure MSLQ or OSLQ at least twice --- maybe once again in the middle. 
Also schedule interviews for LD students at the end. 


Research questions: 
- Do students in Foundations math courses experience greater gains in metacognition in a flipped environment than those in a traditional environment? 
- What positive and negative experiences do learners with diagnosed LDs have in a flipped learning environment?
